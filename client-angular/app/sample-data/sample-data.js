Half a dozen, give or take. Mostly it's filled with startup companies that likely can't afford even the Silver membership.\r\n\r\nI don't really see a problem other than the fact that they have priced it in a way that they will actually get less money than they would if they would price it in another way. I'm fairly certain of this. The individual pricing is very good though, I have no issue with that.",

The foundation of Bitcoin is Satoshi's code, not this organization.

      "content":"The Bitcoin Foundation is modeled on the Linux Foundation. I think Linux is a great \"role model\" for Bitcoin; it is a very successful open source project that really embraced the notion of \"open,\" encouraging the use of the core technology for a wide range of applications.\r\n\r\nI hope that the Bitcoin Foundation will help do the same for Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nOf course, \"the Foundation\" won't do anything at all-- people get things done. I want the Bitcoin Foundation to be an open, member-driven organization, and hope that you or your organization will not only become a member but will help the Foundation accomplish its mission.\r\n\r\nPlease visit the Foundation website for details, and please keep in mind that nothing is set in stone; the structure of the Foundation can be changed by a vote of its members, and exactly what the Foundation does will largely depend on who is willing to step up do the work to make things happen.\r\n\r\nTo any of you feel like you should have been invited to be part of the group who defined the initial structure and purpose of the Foundation: I apologize. But in my experience the larger the group, the longer it takes to get things done, and it has been 11 months since I first posted about the possibility of forming a Foundation.\r\n\r\nIn what will doubtless be an ineffective attempt to fend off the trolls, here are some answers to what I expect might be commonly asked questions:\r\n\r\nQ: Is this the infamous September Announcement?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nQ: How do we know you won't just take our bitcoins and run?\r\n\r\nWe won't. The initial Foundation board members are all people with well established reputations using their real names.\r\n\r\nQ: How do we know you won't lose our bitcoins to hackers?\r\n\r\nWe'll be using a cold wallet, with the private key securely backed up, for most of the Foundation's funds; in the near future I expect we'll be using a multisignature cold wallet, with keys controlled by multiple Board members to keep the funds even more secure.\r\n\r\nQ: Is this just a front for the CIA? What is the hidden agenda?\r\n\r\nNo. And there is none.\r\n\r\nQ: The Foundation is a corporation, and corporations (especially US corporations) are evil.\r\n\r\nOK. So don't join-- go form your own non-corporate non-evil organization, or just ignore the Foundation and do whatever you think is right.\r\n\r\nQ: How, exactly, is the Foundation going to spend the money it gets?\r\n\r\nThat depends on how many bitcoins it gets from memberships and donations. See Peter's \"Letter from the Executive Director\" for the current list of priorities, and see the Linux Foundation website for an idea of the types of things I hope the Bitcoin Foundation will be doing, assuming it has the funds.",

How is this foundation going to respond to government pressure to change the code, to regulate and control who uses Bitcoin and how? It seems like we're going from what was a decentralized system to one where the developers are directly under the influence of the major dues payers and will be, whatever they say now not withstanding, under direct government control.\n\nBitcoin is inherently different than Linux and one thing that brought many users together in using Bitcoin was that it had no central nexxus for control.
