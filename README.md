Freebeer
========
`Freebeer` is a demo GUI front end to the Puffball project. 

Puffball is a decentralized discussion platform. Front end web and mobile developers can create their own GUI front end to Puffball using the Puffball API. All user content is encoded to individual blockchains, allowing a secure & decentralized social platform for sharing of text, audio, video and images.

Please see the [guide to the puffball platform](http://extrazoom.com/image-10847.html). This guide visually outlines the puffball platform and provides an overview of the development roadmap, user accounts/naming, user generated content, the Blockchain, and the Freebeer demo GUI.

Puffball is currently in Phase 1 of the Development roadmap.

### Current Development
`Freebeer` currently reads data from a sample JSON file so GUI development can continue in parallel with Puffball's API team. Once Puffball's API is released `Freebeer` will connect to the live API. 

`Freebeer` and Puffball are currently in Phase 1 of the Development roadmap. The TODO list is located on Trello: https://trello.com/puffball
